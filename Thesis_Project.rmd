## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
General Setup
The model has 3 health states:
Healthy (H), Sick (S), Dead (D)

```{r}
cycle_length <- 1 # cycle length equal one year
n_age_init <- 45 # age at baseline
n_age_max <- 100 # maximum age of follow up
n_cycles <- n_age_max - n_age_init # number of cycles
v_names_states <- c("DFS", "R", "D")


```

We use the discount rate for QALY's and Costs of 3% each. 
The two strategies are going to be:
Strategy 1- Standard of care
Strategy 2- Experimental treatment 

```{r}
n_states <- length(v_names_states) # number of health states
d_e <- 0.04 # discount rate for QALYs of 4% per cycle
d_c <- 0.04 # discount rate for costs of 4% per cycle
v_names_str <- c("Strategy 1", # store the strategy names
"Strategy 2")

## Transition probabilities (per cycle), hazard ratios and odds ratio (OR)

p_DFSD <- 0.003 #probability of dying in DFS
p_DFSR <- 0.15 # probability of DFS to Recurrence
p_RD <- 0.01 # probability of dying in R

# under treatment 2 conditional on surviving
p_DFSR_str2 <- 0.09

#entire cohort starts in DFS
v_m_init <- c(DFS = 1, R = 0, D = 0) # initial state vector

## Initialize cohort trace for SoC
m_M <- matrix(NA,
nrow = (n_cycles + 1), ncol = n_states,
dimnames = list(0:n_cycles, v_names_states))
# Store the initial state vector in the first row of the cohort trace
m_M[1, ] <- v_m_init
## Initialize cohort trace for strategies A, B, and AB
# Structure and initial states are the same as for SoC
m_M_str1 <- m_M # Strategy 1
m_M_str2 <- m_M # Strategy 2

## Initialize transition probability matrix for strategy SoC
m_P <- matrix(0,
nrow = n_states, ncol = n_states,
dimnames = list(v_names_states, v_names_states)) # row and column names
## Fill in matrix

# From DFS

m_P["DFS", "R"] <- (1 - p_DFSD) 
m_P["DFS", "D"] <- p_DFSD

# From R
m_P["R", "R"] <- (1 - p_RD)
m_P["R", "D"] <- p_RD


# From D
m_P["D", "D"] <- 1

## Initialize transition probability matrix for strategy 1 as a copy of SoC's
m_P_str1 <- m_P

## Initialize transition probability matrix for strategy 2
m_P_str2 <- m_P

## Update only transition probabilities from S1 involving p_S1S2

m_P_str2["DFS", "DFS"] <- (1 - p_DFSD) * p_DFSR_trt2
m_P_str2["DFS", "R"] <- p_DFSR_trt2



# Iterative solution of time-independent cSTM
for(t in 1:n_cycles){
# For SoC
m_M[t + 1, ] <- m_M[t, ] %*% m_P
# For strategy A
m_M_str1[t + 1, ] <- m_M_str1[t, ] %*% m_P_str1
# For strategy B
m_M_str2[t + 1, ] <- m_M_str2[t, ] %*% m_P_str2
}
